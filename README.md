# Meter Auth Tree Node

A simple authentication node for ForgeRock's [Identity Platform][forgerock_platform] 5.5 and above. This node can be configured to update a DropWizard Metrics Meter within AM which can then be read using JMX or pushed to a Graphite server.

## Installation

Copy the .jar file from the ../target directory into the ../web-container/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib directory where AM is deployed.  Restart the web container to pick up the new node.  The node will then appear in the authentication trees components palette.

## Usage

Add one or more instances of this node to an auth tree and configure the name of the metric to update by setting the "Metric Key" property.

Each time this node is processed, it will increment the named metric:

## Enabling JMX

JMX access to AM metrics is disabled by default. To enable:

* login to the AM console as AM administrator, and navigate to Configure > Global Services > Monitoring.
* ensure "Monitoring Status" is enabled.
* ensure "Monitoring RMI interface status" is enabled.

You can use tools such as jconsole (included in the Java JDK /bin directory) to connect to AM via JMX.
